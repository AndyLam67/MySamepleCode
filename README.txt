For my final project in college, I make my own game engine with a group of programmers. 
I created the Game Object Manager, to help my teammate to instantiate, destroy, and handle all the game objects.
I also created all the game object related classes. 
I created a parent GameObject class, then inheritance into 2 groups, "MobileObjects" and"ImmobileObjects". 
After that I inheritance all the child class from this 2 big group. 

I am not sure what kind of sample code should I show, so I am giving you my whole GameObject Manager, my GameObject parent class, and two of my child class. 
Please ask me anything if you have any question about my code. Thank you!
